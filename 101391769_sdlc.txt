 -- This file contains details about the importance of learning DevOps engineering in the software development cycle. --

 The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables
the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible
production time.

SDLC in DevOps is about collaboration, automation, feedback, and integrating
development and operations to deliver high-quality software efficiently.

The SDLC has 7 steps:
- Project Planning - the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software
- Gathering Requirments & Analysis - gathering maximum information from the client requirements for the product
- Design - the program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end-user
- Implementation - translating the design into a computer-legible language
- Testing - the testing team tests the functionality of the entire system
- Deployment - it is released for customers to use
- Maintenance - according to the changing user end environment or technology, the software is updated timely
